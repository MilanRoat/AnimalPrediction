# AnimalPrediction
this repository contains the original files of data science project (task 03 ) provided by null class ,created by me 
this repository contains 4 files 
1) animal (1).h5   - the trained model file
2) NULLclasstask03.ipynb - the main file in which model is trained
3) GUItask3.ipynb - can run this directly in your system for validation (have to use the above trained model)
4) few screenshots of GUI
# NOTE
this model is trained on selective spicies of animals like - 'butterfly', 'cat', 'chicken', 'cow', 'dog', 'elephant', 'horse', 'sheep', 'spider'and 'squirrel'. new spicies can be added in dataset but have to train this model again on that.
